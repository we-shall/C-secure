# C-secure
Csecure is a child tracking system. 
The project is based on **child safety and tracking**, whenever a child on boards and off boards the school bus.
The major problem with small kids are they sometimes get into wrong bus and sometimes the bus driver forgets them in the school. The school also cannot keep the track of bus and student this creates a lot of tension both on parents and the school side. So for these problems we came with a solution of CSECURE. Csecure tracks the presence of child in bus and based on the presence it notifies the school(admin), parents and the bus driver.

Technology used are:
* Android
* Firebase
* Raspberrypi
* Python 
* RFid Sensors
